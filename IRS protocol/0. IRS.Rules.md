# A Comprehensive Guide to RULES and WORKFLOWS

In the context of AI-driven development environments, "Rules" and "Workflows" are powerful features designed to enhance automation, consistency, quality assurance, and structured task execution. They provide a programmatic way to guide AI agents through complex processes and ensure adherence to predefined standards.

## 1. Workflows: Automating Repetitive Tasks

Workflows allow you to define a series of steps to guide an AI, such as Cline, through repetitive tasks like deploying a service or submitting a Pull Request (PR). They are essentially automated sequences of actions.

### How to Create and Use Workflows:

1.  **Creation:** Workflows are created as Markdown (`.md`) files with clear, step-by-step instructions for the AI. These files are saved in a designated "workflows directory" alongside "Cline Rules".
2.  **Triggering:** To invoke a workflow, you simply type `/` followed by the workflow's filename in the chat interface, for example, `/[workflow-name.md]`.
3.  **Parameters:** If the workflow requires any specific information, the AI will prompt you to provide the necessary parameters.

### The Power of Workflow Structure:

The real power of workflows comes from how they are structured. They can:
*   **Leverage Built-in Tools:** Workflows can utilize an AI's built-in functionalities like `ask_followup_question` (to get user input), `read_file` (to read file content), `search_files` (to find files or content), and `new_task` (to create new tasks).
*   **Use Command-Line Tools:** They can execute command-line tools that are already installed in the environment, such as `gh` for GitHub operations or `docker` for container management.
*   **Reference External MCP Tools:** Workflows can integrate with external Multi-Context Programming (MCP) tools like Slack or Whatsapp for communication or further automation.
*   **Chain Actions:** Multiple actions can be linked together in a specific, sequential order to automate a multi-step process.

### Real-World Example: A PR Review Workflow

A practical application of workflows is automating a GitHub PR review process. This can significantly streamline a typically manual, multi-step operation.

**Example Workflow (`pr-review.md`) Steps:**

The `pr-review.md` workflow, as described, follows a detailed sequence of steps:

1.  **Gather PR Information:**
    *   It starts by getting the PR title, description, and comments using `gh pr view --json title,body,comments`.
    *   It then retrieves the full diff of the PR using `gh pr diff`.

2.  **Understand the Context:**
    *   The workflow identifies modified files using `gh pr view --json files`.
    *   It examines original files in the main branch to provide context, possibly using a placeholder like `path/to/file`.
    *   For specific sections, it can employ `search_files` with a directory and search term, like `search term` in `*.ts` files within `path/to/directory`.

3.  **Analyze the Changes:**
    *   For each modified file, the AI analyzes what was changed, why (based on the PR description), how it affects the codebase, and potential side effects.
    *   It looks for code quality issues, potential bugs, performance implications, security concerns, and test coverage.

4.  **Ask for User Confirmation:**
    *   Before making a decision, the AI asks the user for approval or a request for changes, providing its assessment and justification. This step uses `ask_followup_question`.

5.  **Ask if User Wants a Comment Drafted:**
    *   After the user's decision, it asks if they would like a comment drafted for the PR.
    *   If yes, it provides a well-structured comment.

6.  **Make a Decision:**
    *   Finally, the workflow can approve the PR using `gh pr review --approve --body "Your approval message"`.
    *   It can also request changes using `gh pr review --request-changes --body "Your feedback message"`.
    *   For multi-line comments that preserve whitespace and formatting, it uses `cat << EOF | gh pr review --approve --body-file -`.

**Benefits of this Workflow:**
*   It automates the context gathering, diff examination, and issue analysis.
*   It simplifies the PR review process from a manual, multi-step operation to a single command.

**Common GitHub CLI Commands for PR Review**:
The source material also lists various `gh` commands for common PR operations, including listing, viewing, checking status, getting diffs, listing changed files, checking out PRs locally, and various review commands (approve, request changes, add comments).

**General PR Review Etiquette**:
Beyond the technical steps, the source also provides guidance on PR review etiquette:
*   Be normal and friendly, thanking the author and @mentioning them.
*   Give a quick, humble summary of changes.
*   Request changes for suggestions or necessary modifications, instead of approving.
*   Leave specific inline comments first, then request changes in the PR with a short overall theme explanation.
*   It also includes examples of PR review comments addressing specific concerns like making changes generic, cross-model compatibility, global endpoint support, theme compatibility, and timeout issues.

### Building Your Own Workflows:

Workflows are highly customizable. You can create them for various repetitive tasks:
*   **Releases:** Gathering merged PRs, building changelogs, handling version bumps.
*   **Project Setup:** Creating folder structures, installing dependencies, setting up configurations with one command.
*   **Reporting:** Grabbing statistics from various sources, formatting them, and even visualizing them with charting libraries or creating presentations.
*   **Team Communication:** Drafting messages to your team via MCP servers like Slack or Whatsapp after submitting a PR.

The key is to identify repetitive tasks that can be described as "first I do X, then Y, then Z".

## 2. Rules: Tailoring AI Behavior

While workflows define sequences of actions, "Rules" (like Cursor AI's `.cursorrules` files) define custom behaviors and instructions for an AI to follow when generating code or interacting with a project. They are configuration files that enhance the AI editor experience.

### Why Use `.cursorrules`?

*   **Customized AI Behavior:** Rules tailor the AI's responses to a project's specific needs, leading to more relevant and accurate code suggestions.
*   **Consistency:** By defining coding standards and best practices, rules ensure the AI generates code aligned with project style guidelines.
*   **Context Awareness:** You can provide the AI with important project context, such as commonly used methods, architectural decisions, or specific libraries, leading to more informed code generation.
*   **Improved Productivity:** Well-defined rules mean the AI generates code requiring less manual editing, speeding up development.
*   **Team Alignment:** A shared `.cursorrules` file ensures consistent AI assistance for all team members, promoting cohesion in coding practices.
*   **Project-Specific Knowledge:** Rules can include information about project structure, dependencies, or unique requirements, helping the AI provide more accurate suggestions.

### How to Use `.cursorrules`:

Rules files are typically placed in a project's root directory. Two methods are described:
1.  **Manual Copy:** Install Cursor AI, find a suitable `.cursorrules` file, copy it to your project's root directory, and customize it.
2.  **Extension-Assisted:** Install Cursor AI, install the `vscode-cursor-rules` extension, use the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) to "Cursor Rules: Add .cursorrules", select and download the file, and then customize it.

### Examples of Rules:

## 3. Integrating Rules and Workflows into the Crypto Analysis Suite's Two-AI Model Workflow

The Crypto Analysis Suite project plan leverages a sophisticated **Two-AI Model Workflow** where a **Reviewer AI (in PLAN Mode)** guides and approves the work of an **Executor AI (in ACT Mode)**. This structured approach ensures meticulous analysis, controlled implementation, and verifiable outcomes. "Rules" and "Workflows" are instrumental in making this two-AI interaction efficient and reliable.

### The Sequential Implementation Plan:

The plan outlines distinct phases and steps, with clear roles for both AIs and mandatory checkpoints. The Executor cannot proceed without the Reviewer's explicit approval at each checkpoint.

**Phase 1: Deep Code Inspection and Refinement (Reviewer: PLAN Mode)**
This phase focuses on thorough analysis, identifying potential issues, and planning the implementation. The Reviewer defines tasks and approves progress.

*   **Step 1: Setup and Initial Analysis**
    *   **Reviewer (PLAN) Action:** Provides instructions for environment setup and initial file review.
    *   **Executor (ACT) Action:** Installs dependencies (`npm install`), configures environment variables (creating a `.env` file with `GEMINI_API_KEY`), and reads/summarizes key project files (e.g., `README.md`, `package.json`, `src/services/geminiService.ts`, `server/index.js`).
    *   **Checkpoint 1.1: Environment Ready & Initial Review Complete**
        *   **Condition:** Dependencies installed, `.env` file created, key files read and summarized.
        *   **Executor Action:** Presents a summary of the initial review and confirms setup.
        *   **Reviewer Approval:** Reviews the summary, confirms setup, and explicitly states "Approved: Proceed to Step 2".

*   **Step 2: Detailed Code Inspection and Bug Fixing**
    *   **Reviewer (PLAN) Action:** Provides specific areas for detailed inspection and potential fixes based on initial analysis.
    *   **Executor (ACT) Action:** Examines and implements logic for the `generateAnalysisFromPrompt` placeholder in `src/services/geminiService.ts`, reviews/refactors `server/index.js`, enhances CSV parsing in `src/utils/csvCategoriesService.ts`, optimizes `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/CryptoTable.tsx` for performance, addresses security concerns, improves error handling, and runs `npm run lint` to fix linting errors.
    *   **Checkpoint 2.1: Code Inspection & Fixes Complete**
        *   **Condition:** All identified bugs fixed, code refactored, security addressed, error handling improved, and linting passes.
        *   **Executor Action:** Presents diffs of changes, a summary of fixes, and linting results.
        *   **Reviewer Approval:** Reviews changes, confirms fixes, and explicitly states "Approved: Proceed to Step 3".

*   **Step 3: MCP Tool Integration (Conditional)**
    *   **Reviewer (PLAN) Action:** Requests clarification on desired MCP tools and provides instructions for their integration.
    *   **Executor (ACT) Action:** Integrates specified MCP tools based on the reviewer's instructions.
    *   **Checkpoint 3.1: MCP Tools Integrated**
        *   **Condition:** MCP tools integrated and verified.
        *   **Executor Action:** Presents confirmation of integration and any relevant output.
        *   **Reviewer Approval:** Reviews integration, confirms functionality, and explicitly states "Approved: Proceed to Step 4".

**Phase 2: Implementation and Verification (Executor: ACT Mode)**
This phase involves executing the application and verifying its functionality after implementing the planned improvements. The Executor performs the actions, and the Reviewer approves the results.

*   **Step 4: Application Execution and Verification**
    *   **Reviewer (PLAN) Action:** Provides instructions for running and testing the application.
    *   **Executor (ACT) Action:** Runs the application (`npm run dev`), tests core features (data loading, table sorting/selection, heatmaps, AI analysis, data export), and verifies that the application is stable and performs as expected.
    *   **Checkpoint 4.1: Application Verified**
        *   **Condition:** Application runs without errors, all core features function correctly, no critical bugs or regressions.
        *   **Executor Action:** Presents confirmation of successful execution and test results (e.g., screenshots, console logs).
        *   **Reviewer Approval:** Reviews results, confirms successful execution, and explicitly states "Approved: Task Complete".

### Flowchart for "RULES and WORKFLOWS" Integration (Description):

This section describes how the environment's "Rules" and "Workflows" features can be leveraged to manage the two-AI model interaction, ensuring sequential progress and automated checks.

**Nodes in the Flowchart**:
*   **Start:** Initiates the overall process.
*   **Reviewer (PLAN) Task:** Represents actions taken by the Reviewer AI (e.g., "Define Step 1 Actions").
*   **Executor (ACT) Task:** Represents actions taken by the Executor AI (e.g., "Execute Step 1 Actions").
*   **Checkpoint (Decision Node):** Represents a point where explicit Reviewer approval is required (e.g., "Checkpoint 1.1: Environment Ready?").
*   **Rule Enforcement:** Represents a "Rule" that automatically checks a condition or enforces a policy (e.g., "Rule: Linting Passed?"). Rules act as automated policy enforcers [Conversation History].
*   **Workflow Trigger:** Represents a "Workflow" that automates a sequence of actions (e.g., "Workflow: Run Tests"). Workflows automate multi-step tasks [Conversation History].
*   **End:** Terminates the overall process.

**Connections (Arrows)**:
*   Arrows show the flow of control between tasks and decision points.
*   Arrows from "Checkpoint" nodes branch based on approval. If "Approved," the process moves to the next step. If "Not Approved," the Executor may re-attempt the task or flag it back to the Reviewer for further guidance.

**Example Flow integrating Rules and Workflows**:

1.  **Start**
2.  **Reviewer (PLAN) Task:** "Define Step 1 Actions" (Reviewer outlines initial setup tasks).
3.  **Executor (ACT) Task:** "Execute Step 1 Actions" (Executor performs tasks like `npm install`, `.env` creation, file reading).
4.  **Rule Enforcement:** "Check: Dependencies Installed?"
    *   This is a "Rule" that automatically verifies if all project dependencies have been successfully installed.
    *   If the condition is not met (e.g., `npm install` failed), the Executor is prompted to re-attempt the action or notify the Reviewer.
5.  **Checkpoint:** "Checkpoint 1.1: Environment Ready?"
    *   The Executor presents its summary and confirms setup.
    *   The Reviewer must explicitly approve to proceed.
        *   If "Approved" by Reviewer: Proceed to Step 2.
        *   If "Not Approved": Executor re-executes "Execute Step 1 Actions" or flags to Reviewer for intervention.
6.  **Reviewer (PLAN) Task:** "Define Step 2 Actions" (Reviewer outlines detailed code inspection tasks).
7.  **Executor (ACT) Task:** "Execute Step 2 Actions" (Executor performs code fixes, refactoring, security addressing).
8.  **Workflow Trigger:** "Run Linting Workflow"
    *   This is a "Workflow" that automates the `npm run lint` command and reports its results. This ensures consistent code quality checks.
9.  **Rule Enforcement:** "Check: Linting Passed?"
    *   This is a "Rule" that automatically verifies if the linting process completed successfully without errors.
    *   If linting fails, the Executor is prompted to re-attempt fixes or notify the Reviewer.
10. **Checkpoint:** "Checkpoint 2.1: Code Fixes Complete?"
    *   The Executor presents diffs, a summary of fixes, and linting results.
    *   The Reviewer must explicitly approve.
        *   If "Approved" by Reviewer: Proceed to Step 3.
        *   If "Not Approved": Executor re-executes "Execute Step 2 Actions" or flags to Reviewer.
11. ...and so on, through all remaining steps, with explicit checkpoints and reviewer approvals for critical junctures.
