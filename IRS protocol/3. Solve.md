# Crypto Analysis Suite - Comprehensive Project Plan

This document consolidates the project overview, file index, analysis findings, and the detailed sequential implementation plan for the Crypto Analysis Suite.

## 1. Project Overview and File Index

The project is a React-based web application for cryptocurrency market analysis, built with Vite. It fetches data from the CoinGecko API and uses Google Gemini for AI-powered market analysis. Key features include sortable data tables, various market heatmaps, statistical analysis, a portfolio simulator, and data export capabilities (CSV and Excel).

### Project Structure Overview

The project is organized into several key directories:

*   `public/`: Static assets, including CSV data and reports.
*   `server/`: Node.js Express server for API proxying.
*   `src/`: Main source code, containing components, services, and utilities.
    *   `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
    *   `src/services/`: API service integrations.
    *   `src/utils/`: Utility functions.
*   `backup_duplicated_files/`: Backup copies of project files.
*   `Claude.Desktop.Instructions/`: AI assistant related instructions.
*   `CryptoAnalysisExports/`: Directory for exported analysis files.
*   `Reports/`: Directory for generated reports.

### Root Directory Files

*   `.env.example`: Example file for environment variables, likely containing `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`).
*   `050725T2039.workspace.code-workspace`: VSCode workspace configuration file.
*   **Documentation & Workflow Files:** A collection of `.md` files (`CHECKLIST_VERIFICACION.md`, `COMMIT_MEJORAS_FINALES.md`, `CREATE_PULL_REQUEST_WITH_CLAUDE_CLI.md`, `IMPLEMENTACION_COMPLETADA.md`, `INSTRUCCIONES.md`, `MEJORAS_IMPLEMENTADAS.md`, `MIGRACION_COMPLETADA.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `PR_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`, `PROYECTO_LISTO_PARA_USO.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_CHECKLIST.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION.md`, `README.md`, `REFACTORIZACION_COMPLETADA.md`, `RESUMEN_REFACTORIZACION.md`, `SECURITY_INCIDENT_REPORT.md`, `VALIDACION_MEJORAS_FINALES.md`). `README.md` provides a comprehensive overview, features, technologies, and execution instructions.

    *   `csvExporter.ts`: Utility for exporting data to CSV format.
    *   `xlsxExporter.ts`: Utility for exporting data to XLSX format.

## 2. Code Inspection Findings: Bugs, Improvements, and Vulnerabilities

Based on my review, here are some key observations:

### Potential Bugs & Areas for Improvement:
*   **`geminiService.ts`:** The `generateAnalysisFromPrompt` function appears to be a placeholder. It should be fully implemented to utilize the Gemini API effectively for generating market analysis based on the provided prompts.
*   **`server/index.js` vs. Frontend Gemini Calls:** The Node.js server (`server/index.js`) also initializes the Gemini API. It's unclear if this server is intended to be run separately or if it's redundant, as the frontend (`geminiService.ts`) appears to call the Gemini API directly. Clarification is needed on its purpose and whether it should be running.
*   **`src/utils/csvParser.ts`:** This file was not found or was empty. However, the necessary CSV parsing logic is present within `src/utils/csvCategoriesService.ts`, so this may not be an issue.
*   **Performance:** While `react-query` and `useMemo` are used, a deeper performance analysis might be beneficial for components handling large datasets like `CryptoTable.tsx` and `App.tsx`.
*   **Dependency Management:** A review of `package.json` could identify outdated dependencies or potential security vulnerabilities.

### Potential Vulnerabilities:
*   **API Key Management:** The project correctly uses environment variables (`.env`) for the `GEMINI_API_KEY`. It is crucial that the `.env` file is never committed to version control to prevent exposure of the API key.
*   **Prompt Injection:** While current prompts are constructed internally, if user input were to be incorporated into prompt generation without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to prompt injection. This does not appear to be the case currently.
*   **CORS:** The `README.md` notes potential CORS issues with CoinGecko. While Vite's proxy and the server's CORS middleware help, it's worth noting as a potential area for browser-specific issues.

## 3. Sequential Implementation Plan (Two-AI Model Workflow)

This plan outlines the step-by-step process for analyzing, refining, and implementing the Crypto Analysis Suite, with explicit roles for a Reviewer (PLAN mode) and an Executor (ACT mode). The Executor cannot proceed without the Reviewer's explicit approval at each checkpoint.

### Phase 1: Deep Code Inspection and Refinement (Reviewer: PLAN Mode)

This phase focuses on thorough analysis, identifying potential issues, and planning the implementation. The Reviewer defines tasks and approves progress.

#### Step 1: Setup and Initial Analysis

*   **Reviewer (PLAN) Action:** Provide instructions for environment setup and initial file review.
*   **Executor (ACT) Action:**
    *   Install dependencies (`npm install`).
    *   Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file with `GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`.
    *   Read and summarize key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `src/index.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/CryptoTable.tsx`, `src/components/AnalysisSection.tsx`, `src/services/geminiService.ts`, `src/utils/apiClient.ts`, `src/utils/csvCategoriesService.ts`, `src/utils/csvExporter.ts`, `src/utils/xlsxExporter.ts`, `server/index.js`).
*   **Checkpoint 1.1: Environment Ready & Initial Review Complete**
    *   **Condition:** Dependencies installed, `.env` file created, key files read and summarized.
    *   **Executor Action:** Present summary of initial review and confirmation of setup.
    *   **Reviewer Approval:** Review summary, confirm setup, and explicitly state "Approved: Proceed to Step 2."

#### Step 2: Detailed Code Inspection and Bug Fixing

*   **Reviewer (PLAN) Action:** Provide specific areas for detailed inspection and potential fixes based on initial analysis.
*   **Executor (ACT) Action:**
    *   Examine `src/services/geminiService.ts`: Implement placeholder function `generateAnalysisFromPrompt` with actual logic.
    *   Review and potentially refactor `server/index.js` (based on reviewer's guidance).
    *   Enhance CSV parsing/mapping in `csvCategoriesService.ts` if needed.
    *   Optimize performance in `CryptoTable.tsx` and `App.tsx`.
    *   Address any identified security concerns (e.g., API key exposure, prompt injection).
    *   Improve error handling across the application.
    *   Run `npm run lint` and fix linting errors.
*   **Checkpoint 2.1: Code Inspection & Fixes Complete**
    *   **Condition:** All identified bugs fixed, code refactored, security addressed, error handling improved, linting passes.
    *   **Executor Action:** Present diffs of changes, summary of fixes, and linting results.
    *   **Reviewer Approval:** Review changes, confirm fixes, and explicitly state "Approved: Proceed to Step 3."

#### Step 3: MCP Tool Integration (Conditional)

*   **Reviewer (PLAN) Action:** Request clarification on MCP tools and provide instructions for integration.
*   **Executor (ACT) Action:**
    *   Integrate specified MCP tools based on reviewer's instructions.
*   **Checkpoint 3.1: MCP Tools Integrated**
    *   **Condition:** MCP tools integrated and verified.
    *   **Executor Action:** Present confirmation of integration and any relevant output.
    *   **Reviewer Approval:** Review integration, confirm functionality, and explicitly state "Approved: Proceed to Step 4."

## Phase 2: Implementation and Verification (Executor: ACT Mode)

This phase involves executing the application and verifying its functionality after implementing the planned improvements. The Executor performs the actions, and the Reviewer approves the results.

### Step 4: Application Execution and Verification

*   **Reviewer (PLAN) Action:** Provide instructions for running and testing the application.
*   **Executor (ACT) Action:**
    *   Run the application using `npm run dev`.
    *   Test core features: data loading, table sorting/selection, heatmaps, AI analysis (if API key is provided), data export.
    *   Verify that the application is stable and performs as expected.
*   **Checkpoint 4.1: Application Verified**
    *   **Condition:** Application runs without errors, all core features function correctly, no critical bugs or regressions.
    *   **Executor Action:** Present confirmation of successful execution and test results (e.g., screenshots, console logs).
    *   **Reviewer Approval:** Review results, confirm successful execution, and explicitly state "Approved: Task Complete."
