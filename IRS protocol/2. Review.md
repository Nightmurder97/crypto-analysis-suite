# Crypto Analysis Suite - Prioritized Action Plan

This document outlines the prioritized actions for analyzing and improving the Crypto Analysis Suite project.

## Phase 1: Deep Code Inspection and Refinement (PLAN MODE)

### 1. Detailed Code Review for Bugs and Vulnerabilities
*   **Objective:** Identify specific code-level issues, potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and areas for optimization.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Examine `src/services/geminiService.ts`: Focus on the placeholder function `generateAnalysisFromPrompt` and the logic for handling API keys and potential prompt injection.
    *   Review `server/index.js`: Clarify its purpose and redundancy with the frontend's direct Gemini API calls. Assess if it needs to be run separately.
    *   Analyze `src/utils/csvCategoriesService.ts`: Ensure the CSV parsing and category mapping logic is robust and covers all expected categories. Check for potential edge cases in matching.
    *   Inspect `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/CryptoTable.tsx`: Look for performance bottlenecks, especially with large datasets, and review the sorting/filtering logic.
    *   Examine `vite.config.ts`: Verify proxy configurations and environment variable handling.
    *   Review `package.json`: Note potential for outdated dependencies or security vulnerabilities.
    *   Look for any hardcoded secrets or sensitive information.
    *   Assess error handling across the application for robustness.

### 2. Clarify MCP Tool Usage
*   **Objective:** Understand your specific requirements for using MCP tools beyond the initial `context7` attempt.
*   **Action:** Ask you which MCP tools you want to leverage and for what specific tasks (e.g., data analysis, automation, integration).

## Phase 2: Implementation and Verification (Requires ACT MODE)

*   Once you approve this plan and switch me to ACT MODE, I will proceed with:
    *   Implementing fixes for identified bugs and vulnerabilities.
    *   Refactoring code for clarity and performance.
    *   Integrating specified MCP tools.
    *   Ensuring the application runs correctly and all features function as expected.
    *   Testing the AI analysis functionality with a valid API key.

## Next Steps & Questions

*   Are you satisfied with this plan, or would you like to make any adjustments?
*   Could you please specify which MCP tools you would like me to use and for what purpose?
*   Do you want me to proceed with the detailed code inspection, or would you like to switch to ACT MODE to begin implementing the plan?
